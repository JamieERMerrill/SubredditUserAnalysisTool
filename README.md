# Subreddit User Analysis Tool  

This was made for a family member to assist in academic research and is not intended for any other 
use public or private. I'm developing it in a public repository in order to make it easy for the 
intended user to grab it. As an unlicensed piece of code, I reserve all rights regarding it, largely
because I'm not of the opinion that it is robust enough for more general use and I don't want to
imply a commitment to do so.
